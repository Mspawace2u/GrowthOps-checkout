      <p>“Patty is absolutely fantastic! She showed me exactly how to train my AI. She helped me create assets in my voice and how to organize everything. This process was incredible. Patty is very knowledgeable and gave me confidence that I will be showing up like a pro while I grow in no time. This was so useful I can't think of a way to make it better. Keep doing what you’re doing!”</p>
