        <h2>🚀 Here’s What You’re Really Getting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One Framework, Unf*cked:</strong> Pick the part of your business that’s making you want to throw your laptop. I’ll tear it down, rebuild it smarter, and hand you the cheat codes.</li>
            <li><strong>A Playbook That Doesn’t Suck:</strong> Forget endless docs. You get a straight-shooting GrowthOps Playbook for finally running your business like you aren’t duct-taping it together at 1am.</li>
            <li><strong>See It, Don’t Just Read It:</strong> Your business, mapped out visually so you can spot the chaos (and the wins) in a single glance.</li>
            <li><strong>Action Tracker for Real-World Brains:</strong> Google Sheets or Notion tracker—organized for humans with too much to think about.</li>
            <li><strong>A Walkthrough That Doesn’t Require Google Translate:</strong> Loom walk-through, minus the techy ego. Expect “aha,” not “WTF?”</li>
            <li><strong>An Actual Quick Win:</strong> A quick action template, script, or tool that makes something annoying in your ops vanish.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔧 How This Goes Down</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You book it.</li>
            <li>You vent (no judgment).</li>
            <li>I map, fix, and hand you the keys.</li>
            <li>You finally see where to start, what to skip, and how to breathe again.</li>
        </ol>
